Here’s an **original free-verse poem** designed to take **~4–5 minutes** to read aloud at a calm pace.

### **Between What Was and What Waits**

I stand
not at the beginning,
not at the end,
but in the narrow corridor
between what was
and what refuses to arrive on time.

The past speaks fluently.
It knows my name,
my shortcuts,
the exact weight of every regret
I learned to carry like a skill.
It taps my shoulder
with memories that feel important
only because they survived.

The future, meanwhile,
is quiet.
Not silent—
just unwilling to explain itself.
It waits like a locked room
with light leaking from under the door,
asking nothing,
promising nothing,
testing how long I can stand
without demanding answers.

I was taught
that progress is loud,
measurable,
a straight line with milestones
you can post about.
But no one prepared me
for the seasons where growth
is invisible,
where effort feels like standing still
and faith feels suspiciously
like pretending.

There are days
I mistake motion for meaning—
fill hours with urgency,
stack tasks like bricks,
build something tall enough
to feel safe.
Yet safety is strange;
it collapses quietly,
often under its own certainty.

Other days
I do nothing heroic at all.
I breathe.
I wait.
I let questions sit unanswered
without turning them into emergencies.
These days feel useless
until much later,
when I realize
they were teaching me restraint—
the discipline of not forcing life
into premature clarity.

I have learned
that certainty is overrated,
but direction is not.
You don’t need to see the whole map
to take the next honest step.
You just need to know
which way is forward
without betraying yourself.

Still, doubt returns
like weather.
It asks if I waited too long,
if I chose comfort over courage,
if I misunderstood the signs
because I wanted them
to mean something kinder.
Doubt has excellent timing;
it arrives precisely
when I’m tired enough to listen.

Yet even doubt
is not the enemy.
It sharpens the questions,
keeps arrogance from settling in,
reminds me that certainty
has a cost I may not want to pay.
What matters is not silencing doubt,
but refusing to let it
hold the pen.

There is a quieter voice—
easily missed—
that doesn’t argue or shout.
It simply repeats:
*continue.*
Not because success is guaranteed,
but because stopping
would be a lie.

So I continue.
With unfinished plans.
With half-formed courage.
With hope that doesn’t sparkle
but endures.
I continue through ordinary days
that don’t feel like stories yet,
trusting that meaning
often assembles itself
after the fact.

One day, I know,
this corridor will open.
The future will step forward,
no longer abstract,
no longer polite.
And the past will finally loosen its grip,
having taught me
everything it could
without asking me to live there.

Until then,
I stand here—
between what was and what waits—
learning that becoming
is not a moment of arrival,
but a long, patient agreement
to stay present
while life decides
who I am next.

And that,
for now,
is enough.
